# Stock Reports Of Companies

Using Marketstack.com API, built a Flutter app that displays stock market reports. I only used the end-of-day data API as it is available on the free plans.

## Marketstack API

[Marketstack](https://marketstack.com/) is a free, JSON-based REST API for real-time, intraday and historical stock market data, supporting 170,000+ stock ticker symbols from 72+ worldwide stock exchanges. The API was built upon powerful apilayer cloud infrastructure, handling any volume with ease - from a few API requests per day all the way to millions of calls per minute, they've got you covered.
